## Extensibility & Future Features

This system is designed to be **extensible and scalable**. The architecture supports adding new features without major refactoring.

### Design Principles for Extensibility

1. **Modular Architecture**: Features are organized in separate modules/components
2. **Service Layer**: Data access is abstracted through service layers (mock → Supabase)
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety across new features
4. **State Management**: Zustand stores can be easily extended or new ones added
5. **Route Groups**: Next.js route groups allow easy addition of new feature routes

### Adding New Features

When adding new features:

1. **Update Documentation**: Add feature to this document and relevant sections
2. **Define Types**: Create TypeScript interfaces in `types/` folder
3. **Create Service Methods**: Add methods to service layer (mock and Supabase)
4. **Add State Management**: Create or extend Zustand stores if needed
5. **Build Components**: Create feature components in `components/features/`
6. **Add Routes**: Create routes in appropriate route group
7. **Update Navigation**: Add to mobile bottom nav or desktop sidebar
8. **Database Schema**: If needed, add tables/columns to database schema
9. **Offline Support**: Ensure new features work offline with sync queue

### Potential Future Features

The following features may be added as the project evolves:

- **Parent Portal**: Parent access to student grades and attendance
- **Messaging System**: Communication between teachers, admin, and parents
- **Timetable Management**: Full class schedule and timetable system
- **Library Management**: Book tracking and management
- **Fee Management**: Fee collection and tracking
- **Transport Management**: School bus routes and tracking
- **Hostel Management**: Boarding house management (if applicable)
- **Examination Management**: Advanced exam scheduling and management
- **Report Generation**: Advanced PDF report generation
- **Bulk Operations**: Bulk import/export of data
- **Multi-school Support**: Extend to support multiple schools
- **Mobile Apps**: Native iOS/Android apps (if needed)
- **Biometric Integration**: Attendance via biometric devices
- **SMS Notifications**: SMS alerts for parents/teachers

### Documentation Updates

**This is a living document** - it will be updated as features are added:
- Feature specifications will be added to relevant sections
- Database schema will be extended as needed
- UI/UX patterns will be documented for new features
- Implementation plans will be updated with new phases
